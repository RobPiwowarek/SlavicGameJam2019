# Happy Tree Enemies 
HTE is a survival / tower defense / platformer(sort of) hybrid 2 player game. Players take role of protecting the heart of the Tree which is being invaded by various enemies. The initial Tree is small and contains a small number of building spots but it can be grown at various points along its trunk. It is possible to choose which part of the tree to grow next. On building spots many variants of supporting pears can be place, some serve as towers while the others give a decent utility boost such as reduction of building cost or increased damage and attack speed of attacking pears. The number of incoming enemies grows over time. As Tree grows it is becoming more challenging to traverse it but it also allows for more firepower and utility through increased number of building spots. The main challenge of the game is the coordination between both players and decision-making which combination of supporting pears and towers is optimal, when to grow tree and rush to repair pears.
